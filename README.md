# remote-work-manifesto

This project is aiming at becoming guidelines for creating a nondiscriminatory, nonviolent environment for remote workers around the world. This is an open-source project, anyone can contribute to it.  

Long ago there were labor unions to establish and protect the rights of common factory workers, we owe them the 40h working week, paid vacations, paid sick leaves, health insurance.  

Now it is our turn to preserve these basics, ensure and improve our working conditions in the digital era when lots of companies are trying to take advantage of people's unawareness and inexperience.
